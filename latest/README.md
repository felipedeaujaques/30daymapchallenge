| 01-11-2024 | Points                | The roman empire made its way past Frankfurt and the RMV service area a long time ago. Unsurprisingly many stations contain the name "Römer". I used free accessible [data](https://opendata.rmv.de/site/files/rmv01/RMV_Haltestellen_Tarifperiode_2023_24_Stand_2024-07-09.zip) from RMV to map these stations. For the visualization I tried out [Felt](felt.com) for the first time. I had a tiny problem while uploading the csv file because Felt expects english decimal separators for longitude and latitude; Uploadw anything is their slogan :smile: Styling and filtering of the data worked very quickly and conveniently. This is the [result](https://felt.com/map/1-30daymapchallenge-2024-EXF6PTLcTOmRzzGz69C9CIXC?loc=50.2451,8.8352,9.04z&share=1). ![image #1](1/1_30daymapchallenge_2024.png "Roman stops") |
| 02-11-2024 | Lines                 | For this challenge I used transportation data from [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org) that I downloaded with duckdb and python into a parquet file. Then I filtered the data in QGIS and created a map showing all road segments that have a cycleway classification only. The result: ![image #2](2/2_cycleways.png "Frankfurt Cycleways in Overture")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 03-11-2024 | Polygons              | Parcels in Germany are usually pain to work with. With this [WMS](https://anbaurecht.traffgoroad.com/geoserver/fba/wms) from the [Fernstraßenbundesamt](https://www.fba.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html) you get geometries and public properties. I created a map of parcels in my home town to show the diversity in size and geometry. The result: ![image #3](3/3_parcels.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 04-11-2024 | Hexagons              | [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu) is a great tool to request data from OSM. For this challenge I pulled wind turbines with the Overpass API from OSM and used matplotlib to create hexagons: ![image #4](4/wind_turbines_germany_hex.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05-11-2024 | A journey             | The German Circle: May of this year was my first trip to the US. Mainly California, Nevada and a tiny bit of Utah. I used qgis to create a point layer with dates from my trip and the in-built temporal controller to style the points as heatmap and export the frames. As background I used the Dark theme from [terrestris](https://ows.terrestris.de/osm/service?VERSION=1.1.1). The result: ![image #5](5/5.gif)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
